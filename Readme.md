# yourVid app

#### Project setup =>
1. .gitignore file but some file want to add so better coder use .gitkeep file also public/temp/.gitkeep
2. .env hide sensitive data so we have to use .env.sample for sometime we have to deploy app but not read this hidden data so it will be needed
3. make 3 files index.js constants.js app.js
4. use nodemon devdependency for server need not to restart again and again.
5. use prettier sometimes developers add extra whitespaces and semicolons missed so it is used to correct this (two files .prettierrc for which want to change, .prettierignore for prettier need not to change this files and folders)
